        <h3 class="subtopic-title">Family History</h3>

        <p>
          The roots of the Chettira Family trace back several generations in Kodagu, where the
          ancestors were granted land in recognition of their service and loyalty. These lands
          formed the foundation of the family’s social and economic standing.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the early 20th century, the family expanded into multiple branches following
          traditional inheritance practices. Around the 1920s, an oral partition divided
          ancestral properties among three main lineages, leading to independent households.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, portions of land were sold, redistributed, and reorganized to meet changing
          family and economic needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, the Chettira Family continues to uphold its traditions, unity, and values while
          adapting to modern education, professions, and lifestyles.
